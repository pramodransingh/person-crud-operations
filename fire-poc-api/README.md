This is a backend project.

It contains the REST endpoints to do operations on Person.

Basic Authentication is used to secure the API's

The default username password for basic authentication is as below
Username = admin
Password = admin

The UI build files are added into the resource/static directory so that the single jar can run the both frond end and backend code.

Running project:

mvn clean install


* Added JUnits and Integration tests . Some integration tests needs to be taken cared.
